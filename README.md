Assignment 4:

Task 1:

Task 1: File Reading with Error Handling
This script focuses on safely accessing and reading data from an existing file.

A Python utility designed to read the contents of sample.txt line by line. It includes a try-except block to handle cases where the file might be missing, ensuring the program provides a helpful message rather than crashing.

Automatically counts and labels each line of text.

Uses .strip() to remove unnecessary newlines for a cleaner console output.

Error Handling: Efficiently catches FileNotFoundError.

Task 2:

Writing and Appending in the file.

File Creation: Uses "write" (wt) mode to start a fresh file based on user input.

Data Persistence: Uses "append" (at) mode to add extra lines to the existing file.

Verification: Reads the final state of the file back to the user to confirm all data was saved correctly.
